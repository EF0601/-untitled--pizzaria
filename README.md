Tycoon games are all the hits, and this is another one...
# Access
To access the game, download the game entirely with every major release. Alpha versions will NOT be released.
A GitHub page will be added soon.
# Dev Diary
The team wasn't working much until Aug 17, when the first major release appeared. Before that, the structure was not even created.
Halfway through development, the original `h1`s and `h2`s were outlined, but the `color` attribute was set to `white`. After one of our devs was working on the footer, he noticed that `black` worked better with the `yellow` text outline.
Soon after the footer was added, `v0.1.0-alpha` was released.
# Extra Cool Stuff
For those of you who want to use our text outline code:
```
text-shadow: -1.5px -1.5px 0 #33ff00, 1.5px -1.5px 0 #33ff00, -1.5px 1.5px 0 #33ff00, 1.5px 1.5px 0 #33ff00;
```
We suggest using black as the color to pair with the yellow outline. You may use this anywhere you'd like. Go on. It's not copyrighted.
