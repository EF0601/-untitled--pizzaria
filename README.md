# Dev Diary
The team wasn't working much until Aug 17, when the first major release appeared. Before that, the structure was not even created.
Halfway through development, the original `h1`s and `h2`s were outlined, but the `color` attribute was set to `white`. After one of our devs was working on the footer, he noticed that `black` worked better with the `yellow` text outline.
Soon after the footer was added, `v0.1.0-alpha` was released. Then we published the pages link.

The `v0.2.0-alpha` added codes. Since we realized people could reload the game, we made it so that the code can be used for infinite games but each game only allows one code.

The `v0.3.0-beta` update is mostly just autoclickers. The autoclicker is actually inspired from the *Idle Tower Building* game. The rest of the stuff is just important structure stuff.
Also we published the release too early: we forgot to sneak a code in.

At the end of `v0.4.0-beta` update, we decided the game was good enough to become v1.0.0. We sneaked in several codes and regrettably added the AFK detector, as we did not want people to just have the game running in the background and not actually enjoying it.

# Extra Cool Stuff
For those of you who want to use our text outline code:
```
text-shadow: -1.5px -1.5px 0 #33ff00, 1.5px -1.5px 0 #33ff00, -1.5px 1.5px 0 #33ff00, 1.5px 1.5px 0 #33ff00;
```
We suggest using black as the color to pair with the yellow outline. You may use this anywhere you'd like. Go on. It's not copyrighted.
